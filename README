logger puts a message (including an integer) with a timestamp (nanoseconds) into a node that is inserted into a list and then reads the messages and timestamps into a text file.

use make logger to compile the program
-h returns a short help list
-n x changes the default integer in the message
-l filename allows you to specify the name of the text file for output
