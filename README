logger puts a message (including an integer) with a timestamp (nanoseconds) into a node that is inserted into a list and then reads the messages and timestamps into a text file.

use make logger to compile the program
-h returns a short help list
-n x changes the default integer in the message
-l filename allows you to specify the name of the text file for output

when you make the executable, there are some warnings about passing incompatible pointer type. I will try to correct these, but for now it seems to work ok.

I used Github for version control. My repository can be found here:
